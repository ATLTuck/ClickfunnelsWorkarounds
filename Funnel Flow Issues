Issue #1:

Funnels are skipping upsells, costing potential sales.

Solution #1:

Edit the Step URL for the upsell that is being skipped, and then change it back to whatever it was.

(If this doesn't work, go on to Solution #2)

Solution #2:

Move order confirmation step up above the upsell that's being skipped, open the step that comes before that, click the 'no' button.
If Clickfunnels takes you to the correct step, put everything back in the correct order and verify that everything is working properly.

(If this doesn't work, go on to Solution #3)

Solution #3:

Make templates of everything inside the affected upsell, delete the step, and load your templates into a fresh upsell.
NOTE: Do not make a step template - this only works if you're using green/blue in-editor templates.
